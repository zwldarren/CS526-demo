#   EditMode   the simulation and the content table, no scene: the fast loop (seconds).
#   PlayMode   the shipped scene booting for real, through the driver and the views (seconds too, but
#              it has to build a player loop and a scene first).
#
# Runs on Windows (Git Bash) and macOS: Tools/locate-unity.sh resolves the editor and hands back the
# path form the native Unity binary takes on that machine.
#
# Usage:  bash Tools/test.sh [EditMode|PlayMode]     (default: both, in that order)
#
# Results land in Logs/editmode.xml and Logs/playmode.xml, logs beside them. Exits non-zero when a
# suite fails, when it wrote no results at all, or when the Editor already has the project open.
