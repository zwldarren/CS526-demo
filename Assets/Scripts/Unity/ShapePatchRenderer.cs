    /// before any drill is placed, so the icon uses the same shape and colour as the belt items it
    /// will become - recognition should not have to be learned twice.
    ///
    /// The icon's appearance comes from the Palette's <see cref="Palette.Visuals"/> shape override,
    /// built once at initialization; unticked it is the built-in silhouette at the patch icon radius,
    /// so an untouched Palette draws exactly what it always did.
    ///
    /// The patches are terrain, stamped once from the map's data and never moving during a run,
    /// and a restart re-stamps the identical layout - so this view has no rebuild reason of its own.
    /// The only thing that changes it is the one reason the gate owns: the icon carries an outline, a
    /// screen-space constant, so a zoom rebuilds it and re-stamps the bed at no extra cost.
